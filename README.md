# clicky-game

## Summary:
In this project, I created a simple memory game with React.js, with the goal of breaking the applications UI into components, managing the component states, and respond to user events.

### Instructions:
1. The app displays a dozen different images of Star Wars action figures. 

2. Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are shuffled. The goal for the user is to click on each image once and only once. 

3. The application keeps track of the user's score. Each time the user clicks on an image for the first time in the current round, the user's score is incremented.

4. If the user clicks on any image a second time in the current round, the user's score is reset to zero.

5. The app keeps track of the user's High Score, and updates it when the user achieves a new High Score.
